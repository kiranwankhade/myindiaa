# E-Commerce Web App Using React & React-router

In this project, I focused on implementing a progressive way.

### Once logged in, users can:
- Home Page
- Log in and sign-up
- logout
- product details page
- Add products to their wishlist
- Remove Items From wishlist
- Add products to their shopping cart
- Update the quantity, or Remove items
- See the total cost
- Payment method
- orders
- Search page
- offline page if network not available

The database includes 3 models: Home, User, Products and Cart, and Wishlist, orders. 
A new "cart item" will be added
to the Cart model with the product ID when a user adds a product to his cart.
