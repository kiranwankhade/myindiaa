# E-Commerce Web App Using React & React-router

In this project, I focused on implementing a progressive way.

### Once logged in, users can:
- Home Page
- login and sign-up
- product details page
- Add products to their shopping cart
- Update the quantity, or Remove items
- See the total cost
- Payment method
- orders
- search page
- offline page if network not available

The database includes 3 models: Home, User, Products and Cart,wishlist. When a user add a product to his cart, a new "cart item" will be added
to the Cart model with the product id.
